                <p>
                    My love for photography began over a decade ago when I picked up my grandfather's old film camera. What started as a hobby documenting family gatherings quickly turned into a lifelong passion for visual storytelling.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I formally studied Fine Arts with a concentration in Photography, which taught me the technical rules of composition and lighting—and exactly when to break them for artistic effect. Since then, I have dedicated my career to capturing authentic connections between people.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Whether I am shooting a high-energy wedding or a quiet, intimate portrait session, my goal remains the same: to create images that make you <em>feel</em> something when you look back at them years from now.
